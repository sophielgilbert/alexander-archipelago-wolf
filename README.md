Title: Readme file for paper and analysis: 'Potential futures for coastal wolves and their ecosystem services in Alaska, with implications for management of a social-ecological system'

Project Description: This is an analysis first begun in 2014/15, originially funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the decision process following the 2nd petition to list the Alexander Archipelago Wolf (Canis lupus ligoni) as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Sophie Gilbert, the quantitative lead of the project, subsequently moved the original spreadsheet model into Program R in 2016, and updated the code in 2020 and 2021 to calculate other metrics, including ecosystem services and disservices of wolves. The paper is now in revision in a peer-reviewed journal.

Installation and use: This code is an R Project, which should be run via downloading and installing R Studio. I suggest cloning this GitHub repository to your own computer's hard-drive, as it is currently in a form that is reproducible (i.e., all input data, source code, and directory structures work together to re-create the analysis and results from our published work)
